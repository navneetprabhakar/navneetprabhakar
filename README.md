# Hey there, I'm Navneet Prabhakar 👋

### Senior Engineering Manager @ Target | AI Agent Architect | Java Enterprise Developer

I lead engineering teams at Target while staying deeply hands-on — building AI agent systems, MCP integrations, and enterprise Java solutions. My work sits at the intersection of cutting-edge AI and production-grade engineering.

## 🎯 Current Focus

- **AI Agent Architectures** — Multi-agent swarm systems with specialized roles for research, analysis, and synthesis
- **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** — Building MCP servers and clients with Spring AI for tool-augmented AI workflows
- **LLM-Powered Applications** — RAG pipelines, chat memory systems, and text-to-query engines (InfluxQL, SQL)
- **Real-time Observability** — Visualization dashboards for monitoring agent-MCP tool interactions
- **Bot Development** — Telegram and WhatsApp bots with comprehensive command systems using Spring Boot
